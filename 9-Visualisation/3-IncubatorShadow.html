<h1>3-IncubatorShadow</h1>

      This tutorial will connect the visualisation created in the last part with the simulated incubator over RabbitMQ. We will have the following steps:

      <ul>

          <li>Set up the C# project</li>
          <li>Start listening to RabbitMQ messages</li>
          <li>Use RabbitMQ messages to change the visualisation</li>
      </ul>

This tutorial is based on the <a href="https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/example_digital-twin_incubator/tree/master/software/digital_twin/visualization">existing incubator visualization</a> created by <a href="https://github.com/lisa5814">Lisa Maria Huynh</a>.

        <h2>a. Set up the C# project</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1. In the project, click on the 'Project' menu, then 'Tools', then 'C#', then 'Create C# solution'.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="figures/c_sharp_solution.png" height="389" width="847"/>

        <ul>
            <li>2. Close Godot.</li>
            <li>3. Copy the 'incubator.csproj' located next to this html file to your project folder. If asked, overwrite the 'incubator.csproj' in that folder.</li>
            <li>4. If you didn't overwrite the file, this means your project is named something else. That's fine. Delete the file named 'YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.csproj'. Rename 'incubator.csproj' so that it replaces the file you just deleted.</li>
            <li>5. Open up Godot and go back to the project. There should be a little hammer icon in the top-right. Click it to build the C# project.</li>
            <li>Note: Godot will auto-build the project before running, so you can just hit the play button when you want to run.</li>
        </ul>

    <img src="figures/hammer.png" height="156" width="149"/>

    <h2>b. Start listening to RabbitMQ messages</h2>

    We're very close to getting the data from RabbitMQ into Godot. At the end of this section, we'll have a Digital Shadow.

    <ul>
        <li>6. From the 'scripts/' folder, copy the <a href="scripts/RabbitMQListener.cs">RabbitMQListener.cs</a> file to your project directory. This has the defaults for RabbitMQ set up already.</li>
        <li>7. Create a new node in the scene tree by right-clicking the incubator node at the top of the pane on the left. Find the 'Node' type, which has a white ring icon. Rename the node to 'rmq_listener'.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="figures/white_ring.png" height="29" width="126"/>

    <ul>
        <li>8. Right-click this new node, and select 'Attach Script'.</li>
        <li>9. At the top of this new node, by 'language', select 'C#'</li>
        <li>10. On the right, select the folder icon, and select the 'RabbitMQListener.cs' file.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="figures/load_c_sharp_script.png" height="411" width="478"/>

    <ul>
        <li>11. Right-click on the top-most node in your scene tree. It should be named 'incubator_root'. Select 'Attach script'. The defaults should be okay, see the figure below.</li>
    </ul>

        <img src="figures/root_script.png" height="407" width="471"/>

    <ul>
        <li>12. Enter the below text into this script file. Note the tabs for spacing in the funcs (short for functions). GDScript is like Python, where the spacing matters. Below is a figure of it within Godot to help you if needed.</li>
        <li>13. What this does is: a) finds the 'rmq_listener' node in the tree, b) connects to it, and c) for every message received, print it out.</li>
    </ul>

        <pre>
    extends Node3D
    @onready var rmq_connection = get_node("rmq_listener")

    func _ready() -> void:
        rmq_connection.connect("OnMessage", _on_message)

    func _on_message(message):
        var data = JSON.parse_string(message)
        print(data)
            </pre>
        <img src="figures/root_code.png" height="250" width="634"/>

    <ul>
        <li>14. Follow the <a href="https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/example_digital-twin_incubator?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-digital-twin">instructions</a> to make sure that the simulated incubator DT is running on your machine. Ex. By running 'python -m startup.start_all_services' in the 'incubator_dt/software/' folder. As has been the case in previous jupyter notebooks, uncomment the unnecessary lines in the 'start_all_services.py' file (see <a href="../1-Incubator-Service/0-Service-Dependencies.ipynb">0-Service-Dependencies</a>). </li>
        </li>
        <li>15. Go back to Godot, and run the project.</li>
        <li>16. If everything went right, then soon you'll see some debugging info. These are the RabbitMQ messages being read in Godot!</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="figures/rmq_in_godot.png" height="247" width="549"/>

    <h2>c. Use RabbitMQ messages to change the visualisation</h2>

        <h3>Visualising the Room Temperature</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>17. Create a 'Label3D' node in the scene tree. This will make a child node.</li>
            <li>18. Rename this node to be 'room_temp'.</li>
            <li>19. Move this node in the 3D space outside of the incubator box, either by using the gizmo or by setting the 'position' property.</li>
            </ul>

        <img src="figures/label3d_create.png" height="319" width="391"/>

        <ul>
            <li>20. Right-click on this node in the scene tree, and select '% access with unique name'. There should now be a '%' symbol beside the node in the scene tree (see the figure below).</li>
            <li>21. As an explanation, this allows Godot to be able to find any node in this scene tree using just the name. We'll use it for the temperature labels to make things easier.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="figures/unique_nodes.png" height="42" width="247"/>

        <ul>
            <li>22. Go back to the 'incubator.gd' script. This can be done by: a) clicking the scroll icon next to the 'incubator_root',  b. finding 'incubator.gd' in the filesystem, or by clicking the 'Script' tab at the top of the editor.</li>
            <li>23. Add the three new lines from code below to the '_on_message' function.</li>
            <li>24. Explanation: The first line makes sure the message is from the right place. The second line finds the node within the scene tree, by using the '%' operator and the node name. The 'as Node3D' part makes sure the following line knows this is a Node3D. The last line changes the 'text' property on the node.</li>
        </ul>

        <pre>
if data.measurement == "low_level_driver":
    var room_temp_label = %room_temp as Label3D
    room_temp_label.text = str(snapped(data.fields.t3, 0.01)) + "°C"</pre>
        <img src="figures/room_temp_code.png" height="194" width="674"/>

        <ul>
            <li>25. If you start the viz, when a new message is received from the incubator, you should see the room temperature update.</li>
            <li>26. Play around with the 'Label3D' node settings. Here, the 'billboard' property is enabled, so that the text always faces the camera.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="figures/room_temp_billboard.png" height="196" width="439"/>

        <h3>Visualising the Heater Temperature and State</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>27. Add a new 'Label3d' node as a child of the 'heater' node. This is done by right-clicking on the 'heater' node and selecting 'Add New Child'.</li>
            <li>28. Name this new node as 'heater_label'.</li>
            <li>29. For the heater and label nodes, right-click on them and select '% access with unique name'.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="figures/heater_label.png" height="54" width="247"/>

        <ul>
            <li>30. Go back to the 'incubator.gd' script.</li>
            <li>31. Add the below code to the '_on_message' function.</li>
            <li>32. Explanation: The first two lines are to set the text of the heater label. The next line gets the material on the mesh of the heater. The if/else sets the colour of the material. And then the last line sets the material back to the mesh.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
var heater_label = %heater_label as Label3D
heater_label.text = str(snapped(data.fields.average_temperature, 0.01)) + "°C"

var heater_material = %heater.get_surface_override_material(0) as StandardMaterial3D
if data.fields.heater_on:
    heater_material.albedo_color = Color.RED
else:
    heater_material.albedo_color = Color.DIM_GRAY
%heater.set_surface_override_material(0, heater_material)
        </pre>
        <img src="figures/heater_code.png" height="441" width="904"/>

        <p>Now when you run the viz, you should see the heater temperature, and it turning red and gray.</p>

        <img src="figures/heater_state.png" height="424" width="504"/>

        <h3>Visualising the Fan State</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>33. Make sure that the fan node is set with '% Access with unique name'. </li>
            <li>34. Then, add this code to the '_on_message' function in 'incubator.gd'. </li>
            <li>35. Explanation: If the fan is on, the second line creates a repeating animation. The last line turns the fan around the X axis. You might need to tweak this depending on how your fan is rotated.</li>
        </ul>

        <pre>
if data.fields.fan_on:
    var fan_tween = get_tree().create_tween().set_loops(3)
    fan_tween.tween_property(%fan, "global_rotation", Vector3(TAU, 0, 0), 1).as_relative()
        </pre>

        <img src="figures/fan_rotate.png" height="353" width="416"/>

        <p>And yes, this means the whole fan rotates. Feel free to improve this if you want, possibly by adding a fan blade mesh.</p>


    <h2>d. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Below is how this project looks at the end of this tutorial. Again, feel free to make your own modifications.</p>
        <img src="figures/final.png" height="470" width="706"/>

        <ul>
            <li>We're close to having a Digital Twin of the incubator. The last step would be to send a RabbitMQ message back to the incubator simulation.</li>
            <li>However, we'll stop here for now with a Digital Shadow, as this step requires complex configuration of the incubator simulation code itself. </li>
        </ul>
